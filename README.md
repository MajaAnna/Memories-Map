#Memories Map

This is a simple website created as a final project of Coders Lab Boot camp.
The main idea was to create a simple responsive website, which contains the map of the world. The names of the countries appear after hovering on particular country. After clicking on the country, short info appear. 

The information about the country contains a data about country's:
 - English and local name
 - image of flag
 - capital
 - currencies
 - languages

If user plans travelling to the particular country, he can add a private note about it.
There is a form attached with questions about: 
- goals
- useful links
- costs of the journey (which will by counted to estimate the final costs)

All the notes are saved in local storage. They can be edited and deleted then.

##The website is written using:
- React
- Sass
- fetch & API
- libraries: simple-react-map and animate.css
- local storage
